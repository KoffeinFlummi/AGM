## Philosophy

*   **Open Source**  
Everyone is free to fork this and make contributions.
*   **Modular Setup**  
Disable/Delete features you don't want.  
*Due to the amount of .pbos you cannot toggle the features in the in-game expansions menu to avoid clutter, but have to be removed from the modfolder manually. Sorry.*  
*   **No Bullshit**  
No gimmicky features that don't add anything to gameplay and are out of place in Arma.  
*(And if there is a feature that you consider unneccessary, just disable it!)*

## Features

*   Improved medical system
*   Realistic names for vehicles and weapons
*   Realistic ballistics including wind and humidity
*   Backblast simulation
*   Weapon resting  
and more...
