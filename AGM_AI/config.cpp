/*
 * Documentation:

 *
 * The idea here is to reduce the AI's godlike aiming
 * capabilties while retaining it's high intelligence.
 * The AI should be smart enough to move through a town,
 * but also be 'human' in their reaction time and aim.
 *
 * Note: All these values can still be adjusted via
 *       scripts, these arrays just change what 0 & 1
 *       are for setSkill.
