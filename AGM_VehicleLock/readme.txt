Adds keys as an item, to lock and unlock vehicles.
Primary target would be role play or TVT, but has uses in all game types, even co-ops (DAC AI will steal unlocked vehicles)

Modules allow fast setup, or can manualy add items and set variables.

Two key modes (can be used together):
Simple Side based keys (e.g. "AGM_item_key_west" works on any hunter)
Custom keys (one key will only open a specific vehicle and nothing else)

Items Added:

AGM_item_key_lockpick
AGM_item_key_master
AGM_item_key_west
AGM_item_key_east
AGM_item_key_indp
AGM_item_key_civ

Magazine added (should never be manualy added, needs to be 'programed' to work on a vehicle):	
AGM_magazine_customKey
